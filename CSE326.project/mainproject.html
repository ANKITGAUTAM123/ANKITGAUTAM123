        Once in a city lived two friends Vikas and Deepak. They started a business venture together by investing money equally.

They worked very hard and after years they earned a lot of money with that business. After sometime Vikas thought of launching a new business venture. He didn’t had enough so he persuaded Deepak to invest with him.
Deepak wasn’t sure about new idea but still agreed.
Both worked hard but their new business failed. They had to face heavy losses and all their hard earned was spent to keep new business from sinking but still their business collapsed.
Deepak couldn’t forgive his friend. He felt that Vikas was responsible for his loss as he was the one who persuaded him to invest in his business idea and because of lack of his judgement, he lost everything.

        As the old saying goes, revenge is a dish best served cold, and the people who have managed to enact revenge on the people in their life who wronged them will never forget the sweet moment that they finally got justice. And for the most part, the people who got theirs never saw it coming.
        While it's easy for an unknowing bystander to see someone having a bad day and not realize that they are really paying for their past sins, it's so much more satisfying to put their actions into context.
        These real stories were so good that they had to be recounted and shared with the world online, even if just to teach a few people that they should be kind and considerate. If they're not, someone else might just notice and seek revenge.
        I live in an apartment building that has end-to-end parking for two spaces per apartment, and access to the parking levels (1-5) are done via a locked automatic roller door, which people can only get through if they have a remote for it (or sneak through behind someone else).
